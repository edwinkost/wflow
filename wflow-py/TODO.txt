TODO:
=====
- Use partial wetness of cell in kinematic wave
- fix open water treatment (together with reservoirs)
- split kinematic wave from SBM and HBV (see restructure)
- Done: Add bare soil evaporation (SBM)
- Done: make unittest for W3RA
- Fix timestep problems, is last time of runinfo included or not
- Remove FEWSRUN item, should not be needed, or done by adapter
- add scalar2grid bmi script to allow scaler input to all models
- merge sbm2 and sbm
- make more unit-tests

TODo Restructure
================
- Split-up into smaller segments (split routing, interception etc) and link with BMI to ready-made models
